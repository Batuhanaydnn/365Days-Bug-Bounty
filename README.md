# 365Days-Bug-Bounty

Hello friends, I am Muhammed Batuhan AydÄ±n. I will progress this repo day by day and prepare simulations of vulnerabilities as much as I can.

## [Repo is Here](https://github.com/harsh-bothra/learn365/tree/main)

Harsh Bothra's 365 days Challangena is designed to give a different perspective. I hope I can successfully complete the challenge. I hope you will learn the techniques not only theoretically but also practically through the simulations within the days. You can try many simulations yourself by browsing the contents of the days.

You can send your simulations written in different languages by forking the repo or you can pr the parts you want to add. Don't forget to star me. I wish you a good day. May you have plenty of code, less bugs and more earnings.
