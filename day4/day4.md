# Unauthenticated and Exploitable JIRA Vulnerabilities

Hello friends, I think there is not much I can tell you today. We are declaring today as CVE reading day and I want you to go and read the JIRA vulnerabilities that I am going to give you and maybe even understand a little bit what JIRA is. Because our brother Harsh Bothra asked us to read these CVEs today. Let me share the CVEs with you here so you don't have to look for them again. I will leave you a link to a video that I will recommend for yesterday. It is a great video from MDISEC channel to understand xxe vulnerabilities much better. Go and do something, see you.
